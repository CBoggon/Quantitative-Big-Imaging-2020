    "No measurement system is perfect and therefore, you will also not get perfect images of the sample you measured. In the figure you can see the slice as it would be in a perfect world to the left and what you actually would measure with an imaging system. Some are of higher quality than others but there are still a collection of factors that have an impact on the image quality.\n",
    "* __Resolution__ Thanks to the optical system there will be some unsharpness caused by scintillator, lenses, and camera. this appears as blurring or the acquired images.\n",
    "* __Noise__ There are different sources of noise when an image is acquired. Most of them are Poisson/Binomial distributed point processes, but thanks to the light spread in the scintillator there can also be some spatially correlated noise.\n",
    "* __Contrast__ Sometimes there is a very low intensity difference between different regions of the sample. This is in particularly problematic when the signal to noise ratio is low.\n",
    "* __Inhomogeneous contrast__ The interaction between radiation and matter may introduce effects that appear as an inhomogeneous contrast. Typical such effects are beam hardening and scattering.\n",
    "* __Artifacts__ The artifacts are features in the image that are not present in the sample. Often this is caused by detector errors or interference of radiation background or seconday radiation events.  \n"
